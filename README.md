# discoverproject_selfmade_cpp_3d_engine

Code made thanks to the tutorial of "javidx9". Modificated only some little parts for test purpose.

## How does it works
Mainly using Matrices this code is making a new 3D engine using the consol named olcConsoleGameEngine.h.
It takes a lot to understand everything about the maths involve there, but it's pretty interesting to see
how much those issues have been studied before and how it works now.

## How to use
Download the project and open it with visual studio. You can then move with the keys "W" "A" "S" "D".
